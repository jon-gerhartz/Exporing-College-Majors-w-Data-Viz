# Exporing-College-Majors-w-Data-Viz
Learning the power of python data visualization tools to evaluate the distribution of the data and the relationships that are present. 
In my efforts to learn python for data science, I explored a dataset of college majors and their outcomes from 2010-2012 using various python plotting tools such as: mathplotlib, pyplot, and scatter_matrix. These tools enabled me to observe the distribution of each column in the dataset and discover correlations between different variables. Notable relationships found include: a negative correlation between the share of women in a major and the median salary. As median salary of a major decreased, the share of women in that major increased. Other relationships that were explored include major vs unemployment rate, median salary vs unemployment rate, the number of men in a major vs unemployment rat, and the number of women in a major vs unemployment rate.
